## Understanding CLAUDE.md vs Skills

This is the most important concept to understand before building skills. Where you put instructions determines how
Claude uses them.

|                   | CLAUDE.md                                                                      | Skill                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **When loaded**   | Every conversation, always                                                     | Only when invoked (via `/name` or auto-detection)                    |
| **What it's for** | Project-wide rules, conventions, context                                       | Specific task workflows, specialized procedures                      |
| **Size concern**  | Always in context, so keep it focused                                          | Only loaded when needed, but keep under 500 lines                    |
| **Examples**      | "Use TypeScript for all files", "Run tests before committing", API conventions | "Generate a PR summary", "Create meeting notes", "Deploy to staging" |

**Rule of thumb:** If Claude should *always* know it, put it in CLAUDE.md. If Claude should only know it when doing a
specific task, make it a skill.

CLAUDE.md instructions still apply inside a skill's execution. A skill inherits your project's rules -- it doesn't
override them. Think of it like layers: CLAUDE.md is the base layer, and the skill adds task-specific instructions on
top.

## Frontmatter Field Reference

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended.

| Field                      | Required    | Type                     | Default                    | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                     | No          | string                   | directory name             | Display name and `/slash-command`. Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only. Max 64 chars.                          |
| `description`              | Recommended | string                   | first paragraph of content | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this for auto-invocation decisions.                             |
| `argument-hint`            | No          | string                   | none                       | Autocomplete hint for expected arguments. Shown in `/` menu. Examples: `[issue-number]`, `[filename] [format]`      |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No          | boolean                  | `false`                    | When `true`, only the user can invoke the skill. Removes it from Claude's context entirely.                         |
| `user-invocable`           | No          | boolean                  | `true`                     | When `false`, hides the skill from the `/` menu. Only Claude can invoke it.                                         |
| `allowed-tools`            | No          | string (comma-separated) | all tools                  | Tools available without permission prompts when this skill is active.                                               |
| `model`                    | No          | string                   | inherit                    | Model to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or omit to inherit.                                                        |
| `context`                  | No          | string                   | none                       | Set to `fork` to run in an isolated subagent context.                                                               |
| `agent`                    | No          | string                   | `general-purpose`          | Subagent type when `context: fork` is set. Options: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, or any custom agent name. |
| `hooks`                    | No          | object                   | none                       | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this skill. See Hooks section below.                                                      |

## Invocation Control Matrix

How `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable` interact:

| Frontmatter                      | User can invoke? | Claude can invoke? | When loaded into context                                             |
|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (default -- both omitted)        | Yes              | Yes                | Description always in context. Full skill loads when invoked.        |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes              | No                 | Description NOT in context. Full skill loads when user invokes.      |
| `user-invocable: false`          | No               | Yes                | Description always in context. Full skill loads when Claude invokes. |

Key nuances:

- `user-invocable` only controls `/` menu visibility, NOT the Skill tool. To block programmatic invocation, use
  `disable-model-invocation: true`.
- `disable-model-invocation: true` is the strongest restriction. It removes the skill from Claude's context entirely AND
  prevents Skill tool access.

---

## String Substitutions

Available placeholders in skill content:

| Variable               | Description                                  | Example                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `$ARGUMENTS`           | All arguments passed when invoking the skill | `/fix-issue 123` -> `$ARGUMENTS` = `123` |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`        | Specific argument by 0-based index           | `$ARGUMENTS[0]` = first arg              |
| `$N`                   | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`                | `$0` = first arg, `$1` = second          |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session ID                           | Useful for logs, session-specific files  |

**Automatic fallback:** If `$ARGUMENTS` is NOT present anywhere in the skill content, arguments are automatically
appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>` at the end.

**Example with positional arguments:**

```yaml
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
argument-hint: [ component ] [ from-framework ] [ to-framework ]
---

Migrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```

Running `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$0` with `SearchBar`, `$1` with `React`, `$2` with `Vue`.

---

## Skill File Locations

Where you store a skill determines who can use it:

| Location   | Path                               | Applies to           | Priority |
|------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Enterprise | Managed settings                   | All users in org     | Highest  |
| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | All your projects    | High     |
| Project    | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`   | This project only    | Medium   |
| Plugin     | `<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`  | Where plugin enabled | Lowest   |

When skills share the same name across levels, higher-priority locations win. Plugin skills use `plugin-name:skill-name`
namespace so they cannot conflict.

**Monorepo support:** When editing files in subdirectories, Claude Code auto-discovers skills from nested
`.claude/skills/` directories (e.g., `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/`).

**Additional directories:** Skills in `.claude/skills/` within `--add-dir` directories are loaded automatically with
live change detection.

---

## `allowed-tools` Syntax Guide

The `allowed-tools` field restricts which tools Claude can use without permission prompts when a skill is active. Your
global permission settings still apply on top of this.

**Basic syntax -- comma-separated tool names:**

```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
```

Claude can use these tools freely. All other tools will prompt for permission.

**Tool-specific patterns with globs:**

```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git *), Bash(npm test), Read
```

The glob pattern inside parentheses filters what arguments Claude can pass:

| Pattern                  | What it allows                                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Bash`                   | Any bash command (no restriction)                                |
| `Bash(git *)`            | Any command starting with `git` (e.g., `git status`, `git diff`) |
| `Bash(npm test)`         | Only the exact command `npm test`                                |
| `Bash(python scripts/*)` | Python on any file in `scripts/`                                 |
| `Read`                   | Read any file (no restriction on arguments)                      |

**Common patterns:**

```yaml
# Read-only skill (no file modifications)
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob

# Can only run specific commands
allowed-tools: Bash(git status), Bash(git diff), Read

# Can only use web tools
allowed-tools: WebSearch, WebFetch

# Can read files and run a specific script
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Bash(python scripts/analyze.py *)
```

**Important:** `allowed-tools` adds *additional* auto-approvals on top of your existing permission settings. It doesn't
remove permissions you've already granted globally.

## Advanced Patterns

### Dynamic Context Injection

The `!`command`` syntax runs shell commands BEFORE the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the
placeholder inline.

```yaml
---
name: pr-summary
description: Summarize changes in a pull request
context: fork
agent: Explore
allowed-tools: Bash(gh *)
---

## Pull request context
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

## Your task
  Summarize this pull request...
```

When this runs:

1. Each `!`command`` executes immediately (before Claude sees anything)
2. The output replaces the placeholder
3. Claude receives the fully-rendered prompt with actual data

This is preprocessing. Claude only sees the final result, not the commands.

**Use cases:**

- Injecting git status, branch info, or diff data
- Fetching live API responses
- Reading environment variables or config files
- Getting file listings or project metadata

### Running Skills in a Subagent (context: fork)

Add `context: fork` to run a skill in an isolated subagent context. The skill content becomes the subagent's task
prompt. The subagent does NOT have access to your conversation history.

```yaml
---
name: deep-research
description: Research a topic thoroughly
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

Research $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:

  1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep
  2. Read and analyze the code
  3. Summarize findings with specific file references
```

**When to use `context: fork`:**

- The task is self-contained and doesn't need conversation history
- The skill produces verbose output you want to keep out of main context
- You want to enforce tool restrictions via the agent type
- The skill is computationally expensive and a cheaper model suffices

**When NOT to use `context: fork`:**

- The skill contains guidelines (like "use these API conventions") without a concrete task. The subagent receives
  guidelines but no actionable prompt and returns nothing useful.
- The skill needs back-and-forth conversation with the user
- The skill needs context from the current conversation

**Agent options:**

- `Explore` -- Haiku, read-only. Best for research, file discovery, code search.
- `Plan` -- Inherits model, read-only. Best for planning research.
- `general-purpose` -- Inherits model, all tools. Best for complex multi-step tasks.
- Any custom agent name from `.claude/agents/`.

**Skills and subagents work in two directions:**

| Approach                     | System prompt            | Task                        | Also loads                   |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Skill with `context: fork`   | From agent type          | SKILL.md content            | CLAUDE.md                    |
| Subagent with `skills` field | Subagent's markdown body | Claude's delegation message | Preloaded skills + CLAUDE.md |

### Supporting Files

Skills can include multiple files in their directory. Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines and move detailed reference material
to separate files.

```
my-skill/
  SKILL.md              # Main instructions (required, <500 lines)
  reference.md          # Detailed docs
  scripts/
    helper.py           # Utility script
```

Reference them from SKILL.md so Claude knows they exist. Supporting files are NOT loaded automatically -- they load only
when Claude needs them.

### Hooks in Skills

Skills can define lifecycle hooks in frontmatter. These hooks only run while the skill is active.

```yaml
---
name: safe-editor
description: Edit files with automatic linting
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-command.sh"
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/run-linter.sh"
---
```

**Supported hook events in skills:**

| Event         | Matcher input | When it fires                                                  |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PreToolUse`  | Tool name     | Before the skill uses a tool                                   |
| `PostToolUse` | Tool name     | After the skill uses a tool                                    |
| `Stop`        | (none)        | When the skill finishes (converted to SubagentStop at runtime) |

Hook commands receive JSON input via stdin with the tool context. Exit code 0 = allow, exit code 2 = block.

### Visual Output (Bundled Scripts)

Skills can bundle scripts that generate visual output (HTML, images, charts). This extends Claude's capabilities beyond
text.

```yaml
---
name: codebase-visualizer
description: Generate an interactive tree visualization of your codebase
allowed-tools: Bash(python *)
---

# Codebase Visualizer

Run the visualization script:

  ```bash
  python ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py .
```

```

The skill provides orchestration instructions while the bundled script does the heavy lifting. This pattern works for dependency graphs, test coverage reports, API docs, or any visual output.

### Extended Thinking (Ultrathink)

Claude Code supports an extended thinking mode that enables deeper, more thorough reasoning before responding. To activate it within a skill, include the word `ultrathink` anywhere in your skill content.

**When to use it:**
- Complex analysis that requires weighing multiple factors
- Architecture decisions with trade-offs
- Debugging tasks where root cause analysis matters
- Any task where you want Claude to "think harder" before acting

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: architecture-review
description: Review and critique architecture decisions
---

ultrathink

Review the following codebase architecture...
```

The word can appear anywhere -- in a comment, a heading, or inline text. Its presence alone activates extended thinking
for that skill's execution.

---

## Permissions and Access Control

### Restrict Claude's Skill Access

Three ways to control which skills Claude can invoke:

**1. Disable all skills** by denying the Skill tool in `/permissions`:

```
# Add to deny rules:
Skill
```

**2. Allow or deny specific skills** using permission rules:

```
# Allow only specific skills
Skill(commit)
Skill(review-pr *)

# Deny specific skills
Skill(deploy *)
```

Syntax: `Skill(name)` for exact match, `Skill(name *)` for prefix match with any arguments.

**3. Hide individual skills** by adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to their frontmatter.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not triggering

If Claude doesn't use your skill when expected:

1. **Check the description** -- Does it include keywords users would naturally say? The description is how Claude
   decides to load the skill.
2. **Verify it's visible** -- Ask "What skills are available?" to confirm Claude sees it.
3. **Rephrase your request** -- Try wording that more closely matches the description.
4. **Invoke directly** -- Use `/skill-name` to confirm the skill works at all.
5. **Check `disable-model-invocation`** -- If set to `true`, Claude cannot auto-invoke. Only `/skill-name` works.

### Skill triggers too often

If Claude uses your skill when you don't want it:

1. **Make the description more specific** -- Narrow the trigger conditions.
2. **Add `disable-model-invocation: true`** -- If you only want manual invocation.

### Claude doesn't see all skills

Skill descriptions are loaded into context. If you have many skills, they may exceed the character budget (2% of context
window, fallback 16,000 chars total across ALL skills).

- Check: Run `/context` to see if skills are being excluded.
- Fix: Keep descriptions concise and keyword-rich. Override with `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` env var if needed.

### Subagent skill returns nothing useful

If a skill with `context: fork` returns empty or unhelpful results:

- The skill probably contains guidelines without a concrete task. Subagents need an actionable prompt, not just
  reference material.
- Add explicit instructions: "Do X, then return Y."

### Arguments not being substituted

- Verify `$ARGUMENTS`, `$N`, or `$ARGUMENTS[N]` appears in the skill content.
- If none appear, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>` at the end (automatic fallback).
- Arguments are space-delimited. If an argument contains spaces, it may split unexpectedly.
