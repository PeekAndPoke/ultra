# ULTRA-00331: Kontainer: a prototype redefined as dynamic stays a prototype

> **Status (2026-11-14): NOT STARTED.**

> **Part of:** ULTRA-00255 (Epic: Ultra libraries (module scans and defects))

**Found by:** the characterization specs of ULTRA-00319 (Kontainer injection type split), step 1, 2026-11-14.

## Why this exists

A prototype redefined as dynamic stays `Prototype`: singletons that inject it are not promoted, and `create { with { } }` refuses an override for it.

Pinned as it is today in `ultra/kontainer/src/test/kotlin/e2e/characterization/RedefinitionCharacterizationSpec.kt`, in a test
whose name starts with "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR". The split of ULTRA-00319 keeps this behaviour unchanged; the fix is this
ticket (maintainer, 2026-11-14: "fix each with its own ticket").

## The work

- Decide the redefinition table for all pairs of (ServiceType, ServiceKind), `dynamicPrototype` included, and make builder and `extend` follow it (see ULTRA-00330).
- Tests first: the "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR" pin turns into the wanted expectation (RED before the fix); mutation check.
- CHANGELOG: a behaviour change without a compile signal.

## Acceptance

- The pin no longer says "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR"; `:ultra:kontainer:test` and the consumer suites are green.

## History

- 2026-11-14: created on the maintainer's word.
