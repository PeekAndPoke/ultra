# ULTRA-00327: Kontainer: validation runs only once, even when it failed

> **Status (2026-11-14): NOT STARTED.**

> **Part of:** ULTRA-00255 (Epic: Ultra libraries (module scans and defects))

**Found by:** the characterization specs of ULTRA-00319 (Kontainer injection type split), step 1, 2026-11-14.

## Why this exists

After a failed validation the next `create()` of the same blueprint succeeds: the "validated" flag is set before `validate()` runs. `get` on that kontainer then throws `InvocationTargetException` where the caller should have got the validation error again.

Pinned as it is today in `ultra/kontainer/src/test/kotlin/e2e/characterization/ValidationCharacterizationSpec.kt`, in a test
whose name starts with "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR". The split of ULTRA-00319 keeps this behaviour unchanged; the fix is this
ticket (maintainer, 2026-11-14: "fix each with its own ticket").

## The work

- The flag is set only after a successful validation (or the failure is remembered and rethrown). A blueprint that failed validation fails on every `create()` with the same `KontainerInconsistent`.
- Tests first: the "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR" pin turns into the wanted expectation (RED before the fix); mutation check.
- CHANGELOG: a behaviour change without a compile signal.

## Acceptance

- The pin no longer says "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR"; `:ultra:kontainer:test` and the consumer suites are green.

## History

- 2026-11-14: created on the maintainer's word.
