# ULTRA-00334: Kontainer: a decorator is reported as a cycle with itself

**Found by:** the characterization specs of ULTRA-00319 (Kontainer injection type split), step 1, 2026-11-14.

## Why this exists

A decorator with a nullable parameter of its own super type, `DecoratingRepo(inner: Repo?) : Repo`, is reported by validation as a cycle with itself ("DecoratingRepo -> DecoratingRepo").

Pinned as it is today in `ultra/kontainer/src/test/kotlin/e2e/characterization/ValidationCharacterizationSpec.kt`, in a test
whose name starts with "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR". The split of ULTRA-00319 keeps this behaviour unchanged; the fix is this
ticket (maintainer, 2026-11-14: "fix each with its own ticket").

## The work

- A service is not a candidate for its own super-type parameter; the decorator resolves to the other implementation, or to null when there is none.
- Tests first: the "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR" pin turns into the wanted expectation (RED before the fix); mutation check.
- CHANGELOG: a behaviour change without a compile signal.

## Acceptance

- The pin no longer says "CURRENT BEHAVIOUR"; `:ultra:kontainer:test` and the consumer suites are green.

## History

- 2026-11-14: created on the maintainer's word.
